## The Role of Coding Standards in Software Engineering

Coding standards are more than just rules about indentation or bracket placementâ€”they are essential for writing high-quality, maintainable code. By enforcing consistency, they make it easier for teams to collaborate, reduce errors, and improve readability. More importantly, coding standards can also serve as a learning tool, helping developers adopt best practices and better understand the nuances of a programming language. In my experience, following coding standards has made my code more structured and easier to debug, reinforcing good habits that will benefit me in the long run.

## My Experience with ESLint in VSCode

During my first week using ESLint with VSCode, I initially found resolving all the errors and warnings tedious. Some seemed overly strict, especially when they flagged minor formatting issues. However, as I continued, I realized that ESLint was guiding me toward writing cleaner and more efficient TypeScript code. The warnings helped me avoid common pitfalls, such as using unnecessary variables or writing inefficient functions. Although the process required extra effort, it ultimately improved my understanding of TypeScript and reinforced good coding practices.

## The Long-Term Benefits of Coding Standards

Coding standards, especially when enforced through tools like ESLint, contribute to more than just stylistic consistency. They promote discipline, encourage best practices, and help prevent technical debt. While it may be tempting to view them as an inconvenience, adhering to coding standards ultimately leads to better software quality, easier maintenance, and improved collaboration. Rather than seeing them as a burden, I now appreciate them as a fundamental aspect of professional software development.
